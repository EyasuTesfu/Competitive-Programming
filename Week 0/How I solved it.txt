The required code in simple terms is:
 a code that takes in an integer value in the range(1,10^4),
and return a string array of the numbers 1 up to the integer value given,
and it replaces the number with "Fizz" if the number is divisible with 3,
and "Buzz" if it is divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
all this happens prior to parsing the number to string, 
if none of the above cases apply( or it is not divisible by 5 or 3), then =>
the string parsed integer will be appended and the list holding it will be returned 
when the loop finishes
